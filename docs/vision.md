# Product Vision

Keep this file current so every agent session starts with the same mental model. Update it whenever the user journey or goals shift.

## 1. Problem & Audience
- Who is the primary user?
- What pain are we solving?
- Why now?

## 2. Core Experience
- Happy-path narrative (step-by-step walkthrough).
- Supporting flows (error handling, empty states, success feedback).
- Out of scope (what we explicitly defer).

## 3. Feature Inventory
Numbered list of features or capabilities. Reference these numbers in `docs/Plan.md` checkpoints.

## 4. Success Criteria
- Quantitative targets (metrics, test coverage, performance budgets).
- Qualitative gates (accessibility, UX reviews, documentation).

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions
- Technical constraints (stack choices, integrations, performance budgets).
- Business or compliance constraints.
- Known risks or unknowns (tag @Scout for research if needed).

## 6. Links & Artifacts
- GitHub issue(s)
- Design mocks
- Research notes (`docs/research.md`)
- Connection guide (`docs/ConnectionGuide.md`)

**Process Reminder:** Vector verifies this vision at the start of every feature. If it’s outdated, stop and update it before more code lands.
