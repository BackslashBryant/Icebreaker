# Session Context Log

Use this file to capture session summaries so future chats can reload context quickly.

## How to Use
- At the end of each working session, run `/session-summary` and paste the output here.
- Include date/time, focus area, checkpoints touched, and next actions.
- Keep newest entries at the top for quick reference.

## Entries
(Example)
### 2025-11-10 – Feature: Health Dashboard
- Completed checkpoints: 1 (API scaffold)
- Next checkpoints: 2 (UI), 3 (tests)
- Risks / blockers: Need auth decision
- Next actions: Ask @Vector to adjust plan after auth decision

(Add your latest summary above this line.)
