# Test Personas

This directory contains detailed user personas for testing, user research, and product development insights.

## Purpose

These personas represent our target demo users with realistic social media profiles. They help us:
- **Test scenarios**: Emulate real user behavior during testing
- **User research**: Understand why users seek IceBreaker as an alternative
- **Product insights**: Guide feature development based on real user needs
- **Content strategy**: Position IceBreaker against traditional social platforms

## Usage

When testing or researching:
- Reference these personas to understand user motivations
- Use their social media profiles to contrast with IceBreaker's ephemeral approach
- Emulate their behavior patterns during manual testing
- Reference them in user research interviews and testing scenarios

## IceBreaker Profile Mapping

Each persona also includes their expected IceBreaker profile configuration (vibe, tags, visibility) for testing purposes. See individual persona files for details.

**Note**: These personas represent the performative social media profiles that IceBreaker intentionally avoids. They help us understand why users seek an ephemeral, low-pressure alternative.
