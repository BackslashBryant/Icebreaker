## IceBreaker Profile Configuration

**For Testing:**
- **Vibe**: `thinking` ("Thinking out loud")
- **Tags**: `["Quietly Curious", "Overthinking Things"]`
- **Visibility**: `true` (wants to be found, but cautiously)
- **Expected Handle Pattern**: `[Adjective]Thinker[Number]` or `[Adjective]Observer[Number]` (e.g., "QuietThinker42", "CozyObserver73")

**Testing Notes:**
- May toggle visibility off/on frequently
- Likely to select 2-3 tags (not too many, not none)
- Should appear on Radar for others with "thinking" vibe or shared tags
- Signal score should be boosted by shared tags with other anxious students

## Testing Scenarios

- **College Library**: Same approximate coordinates as other students
- **Expected Behavior**: Should match well with Zoe (shared "Overthinking Things" tag)
- **Use Case**: Testing proximity matching, shared tag compatibility, visibility toggling
