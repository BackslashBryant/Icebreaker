# Architecture

This template ships with a minimal architecture scaffold.

- Monorepo via pnpm workspaces and Turbo
- Apps: `frontend/`, `backend/`
- Shared types/utilities: `shared/`

## ADR Template
See `docs/architecture/monorepo-decision.md` as an example ADR. For new decisions, copy that structure into a new file named `adr-XXXX-title.md`.
