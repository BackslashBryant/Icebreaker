# IceBreaker — Onboarding Vision

> This is the buy‑in moment. We earn trust with clarity, choice, and respect for attention. Keep it short, human, and intentional.

---

## 🌟 Purpose

Onboarding should:

1. State the promise in plain language.
2. Give users control (consent, visibility, vibe).
3. Get them to Radar fast without feeling rushed.

No tricks. No forced identity performance.

## 🎮 Flow (end‑to‑end)

1. **Welcome**

   * Brand moment. Retro logo + calm headline: *“Real world. Real time. Real connections.”*
   * Two clean CTAs: **Press Start** / **Not for me** (graceful exit screen).

2. **18+ Consent**

   * Single checkbox: *“I confirm I am 18 or older.”*
   * Continue disabled until checked. Cursor visibly focuses.

3. **Location Explainer**

   * Minimal teal icon + terminal-style copy.
   * Plain text: *“We use approximate location to connect you with nearby people. Not stored long‑term.”*
   * CTAs: **Enable Location** / **Skip for now** (reduced experience).

4. **Vibe & Tags**

   * **Vibe (required):** *“What kind of energy are you putting out right now?”*
     Options: 🙃 Up for banter · 🤝 Open to intros · 🧠 Thinking out loud · ⏳ Killing time · 🎲 Surprise me
   * **Tags (optional):** *“Want to give folks a sense of your wavelength?”*
     Chips (examples): Quietly Curious · Creative Energy · Overthinking Things · Big Sci‑Fi Brain · Here for the humans
   * **Visibility toggle:** *“Show me on the radar.”*
   * **Soft penalty:** Skipping all tags is allowed, **but lowers discoverability** on Radar.

5. **Done → Radar**

   * Short success toast; no confetti, no noise.

## 🎨 UI & Tone (applied to onboarding)

* **Theme:** terminal meets Game Boy. Deep navy/charcoal base; neon teal accents; warm gray copy.
* **Type:** IBM Plex Mono / Space Mono (headers in caps, body in sentence case).
* **Motion:** CRT sweep and subtle pulses — all disabled in reduced‑motion.
* **Buttons:** rounded‑2xl, teal fill, clear focus rings.
* **Microcopy:** confident, succinct, a touch playful; never clingy.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

* **Reduced‑motion:** disable sweep, blink, pulse animations.
* **High‑contrast:** brighten teal; ensure WCAG text contrast.
* **Keyboard/Screen reader:** Order is logical; all CTAs have labels; focus visibly moves.
* **Plain language:** Short, concrete sentences; no jargon.

---

## 🔐 Trust & Privacy Notes (visible in flow)

* Explicit 18+ confirmation.
* Location is **approximate** and **session‑based**.
* Vibes/Tags are **signals for now**, not permanent identity.
* Visibility is reversible any time.

---

## 🧠 Product Rules (dev decisions)

* **Choice everywhere**: every step has a dignified opt‑out.
* **Speed**: user can reach Radar in **<30 seconds**.
* **Authenticity > theatrics**: keep interactions minimal and honest.
* **Penalty is soft, not punitive**: skipping tags reduces priority but never blocks use.

---

## 🔖 Future Flags (design for extension)

* **Social enrichment (post‑MVP):** Optional OAuth for Spotify/Reddit/X to auto‑suggest tags; must be clearly opt‑in and privacy‑framed.
* **Personality/archetype mode:** Small, respectful archetypes for users who prefer structured identity hints.
* **Tagless mode:** Always allowed; **reduced discoverability** remains the tradeoff.

---

## ✅ Acceptance (experience‑level)

* User understands IceBreaker in **~10 seconds** on Welcome.
* 18+ and Location steps are friction‑light and transparent.
* Vibe selection is quick; tags are clearly optional.
* Accessibility modes (reduced‑motion, high‑contrast) persist across steps.
* From first screen to Radar in **under 30 seconds** for a decisive user.

> Build this like a manifesto: short, honest, and respectful of the moment.
