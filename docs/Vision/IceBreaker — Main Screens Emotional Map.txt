# IceBreaker — Main Screens Emotional Map

> Quick‑read reference for what each screen should *feel like*, the promise it delivers, and the guardrails that keep us on‑brand.

---

## 1) Splash / Welcome

**Feel:** Quiet confidence; retro‑handheld wink; intentional choice.
**Promise:** "This is different. Real world, real time, real connections."
**Must not:** Beg, hype, or trap.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“Press Start”* · *“Not for me”*
**A11y note:** Reduced‑motion disables sweep; buttons have visible focus.

---

## 2) 18+ Consent

**Feel:** Straightforward, respectful.
**Promise:** Adult space, safety first.
**Must not:** Guilt or dramatize.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“I confirm I am 18 or older.”*

---

## 3) Location Explainer

**Feel:** Transparent, calm, empowering.
**Promise:** Approximate, session‑based location; your choice.
**Must not:** Bury details or coerce.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“Enable Location”* · *“Skip for now”*

---

## 4) Vibe & Tags

**Feel:** Present‑tense, low effort, optional identity hints.
**Promise:** You control what’s shown; signals improve relevance.
**Must not:** Force identity performance.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“What kind of energy are you putting out right now?”*
**Rule:** Skipping tags allowed → **reduced discoverability** (soft penalty).

---

## 5) Profile

**Feel:** Agency and clarity.
**Promise:** You decide visibility; you manage safety contacts.
**Must not:** Invite resume‑building or clout signals.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“Choose what they see. Stay in control.”*

---

## 6) Settings

**Feel:** Respectful autonomy.
**Promise:** Your space, your rules (a11y toggles, sign out).
**Must not:** Hide critical controls.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“Your space, your rules.”*

---

## 7) Radar

**Feel:** Ambient presence; quietly relevant.
**Promise:** People nearby who match your vibe — no pressure.
**Must not:** Look like a feed or leaderboard.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“No one here — yet.”*
**Rule:** Lightweight compatibility sorts; no avatars; safety can hide.

---

## 8) Chat

**Feel:** Focused, ephemeral, terminal‑clean.
**Promise:** Say it while it matters; then it fades.
**Must not:** Add stickers, reactions, or history.
**Microcopy anchor:** *“Connection lost. Chat deleted.”*

---

## 9) Panic

**Feel:** Reassuring, immediate, calm.
**Promise:** One tap to exit and alert contacts.
**Must not:** Be dramatic or hidden.
**Microcopy anchor:** Modal *“Everything okay?”* → *“Send alert & exit”* / *“Never mind”*

---

## Visual & Tone Guardrails (applies everywhere)

* **Theme:** Terminal meets Game Boy. Deep navy/charcoal base; neon teal accents; warm gray text.
* **Type:** IBM Plex Mono / Space Mono (caps for headers; sentence case body).
* **Motion:** CRT sweep/blink/pulse — always respect reduced‑motion.
* **A11y:** High‑contrast toggle; keyboard paths; ARIA labels.
* **Do:** One intent per screen. Use space. Let the moment breathe.
* **Don’t:** Add social graph cues, clout badges, or noisy chrome.

---

## Acceptance (per screen)

* The *feel* and *promise* are obvious within 3 seconds.
* Copy matches tone examples; no hype, no guilt.
* Reduced‑motion/high‑contrast work consistently.
* Interactions are minimal and intentional; nothing competes with the single purpose of the screen.
