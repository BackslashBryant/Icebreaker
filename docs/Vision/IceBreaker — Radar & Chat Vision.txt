# IceBreaker — Radar & Chat Vision

> This is the emotional core of IceBreaker. Radar shows quiet presence. Chat makes the moment real. Then it ends — intentionally.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* **Radar**: Surface nearby people who are open right now — without pressure or profiles.
* **Chat**: Enable a brief, real exchange — then let it fade when proximity ends.

## 🛰️ Radar — Presence without pressure

**What it is**

* A scan‑style view (CRT sweep) of who’s within range.
* Chunky pixel dots or accessible list. **No avatars. No follower cues.**
* Sorts by lightweight compatibility so relevance quietly leads.

**What it should feel like**

* A subtle ping — like glancing around a room.
* Calm, minimal, and respectful of attention.

**UI language**

* Deep navy/charcoal base; neon teal accents.
* Empty state: *“No one here — yet.”*
* Permission/GPS‑off states are clear and dignified.

**Visibility & compatibility rules (MVP)**

* Visibility ON → eligible to appear.
* Skipping all tags → **reduced discoverability** (soft penalty).
* **Score hints placement**: higher score = closer to center / slightly stronger pulse.

**MVP scoring**

* 🎯 Vibe match (same) → strong boost
* 🔗 Shared tags → additive boost per tag
* 🧍 Visibility ON → small boost
* 🚫 No tags → soft penalty
* 🛟 Recent panic → **hide** (safety first)

> **Future flag**: Evolve into a "Signal Engine" that can learn from passive feedback (accept/decline, chat duration). Always privacy‑respecting; no message content stored.

## 🗨️ Chat — Brief, intentional, ephemeral

**What it is**

* 1:1 real‑time exchange that ends when proximity ends.
* No history, no threads, no reactions — **say it while it matters.**

**UI language**

* Black background; teal monospaced text.
* Timestamps `[HH:MM]`; ASCII dividers between bursts.
* Optional toast when proximity weakens: *“Signal weak — chat may end.”*

**End of moment**

* When range breaks (or Panic): instant close.
* Copy: *“Connection lost. Chat deleted.”*

> **Future flag**: Client‑side encryption can be added later behind a feature flag; ephemerality stays the same.

## 🛟 Panic — Always accessible

* Teal FAB visible on Radar and Chat.
* Confirm modal: *“Everything okay?”* → **Send alert & exit** / **Never mind**.
* After action toast: *“You’re safe. Session ended.”*

---

## ♿ Accessibility

* Reduced‑motion disables sweeps, blinks, pulses.
* High‑contrast brightens teal and ensures WCAG text contrast.
* Full keyboard paths; ARIA labels on dots, list items, and FAB.

## 🧠 Decision rules

1. Presence over profile.
2. Simplicity over cleverness.
3. Safety over stickiness.
4. If a choice risks the vibe, choose the vibe.

---

## ✅ Acceptance (experience‑level)

* Radar handles **empty / denied / GPS‑off** states gracefully.
* Sorting feels quietly relevant; no one is fully hidden (except for safety).
* Chat starts in **one tap** and feels instant.
* Chats **always end** on proximity break or Panic, with clear copy.
* Reduced‑motion and high‑contrast are respected throughout.

> Build this like a ritual: quiet arrival, brief spark, clean fade.
