# IceBreaker — Signal Engine Vision

> The Signal Engine ranks nearby presence so Radar feels *quietly relevant* without turning into a popularity contest. It is lightweight, privacy‑respecting, and explainable to users and devs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Reduce noise in crowded spaces
* Surface *compatible now* (not famous forever)
* Stay transparent, fair, and easy to tune

---

## 🧠 Principles

1. **Now > Always** — prioritize current vibe and session context.
2. **Privacy by design** — no social graphs; approximate distance; no message content stored.
3. **Explainable** — simple scoring you can read in a table.
4. **Soft, not hard** — avoid strict filters; prefer sort order.
5. **Safety wins** — panic/safety signals can fully remove.

## ⚙️ MVP Inputs (per user pair A→B)

* `vibe_match` — same vibe selected this session (boolean)
* `shared_tags` — count of overlapping optional tags (0..N)
* `visibility_on` — B’s visibility toggle (boolean)
* `tagless` — B selected no tags (boolean)
* `safety_flag` — recent panic by/near B (boolean)
* `proximity_tier` — coarse bucket (e.g., within room / venue / nearby)

> **No past chats, no social graph.** All signals are session‑level and ephemeral.

## 📐 MVP Score (interpretable)

```
score(A,B) =
  w_vibe   * VIBE_MATCH(A,B)           +
  w_tag    * MIN(shared_tags(A,B), 3)  +
  w_vis    * VISIBILITY_ON(B)          +
  w_tagless* TAGLESS(B)                +
  w_dist   * PROXIMITY_TIER(A,B)
```

**Default weights (tunable):**

* `w_vibe = +10`
* `w_tag  = +5` (per tag, up to 3)
* `w_vis  = +3`
* `w_tagless = −5`
* `w_dist = +2` (closer bucket gets higher multiplier)

**Safety rule:** if `safety_flag == true` → **exclude B** from A’s results.

**Tie‑breakers:** stable random seed per session to avoid jitter; then alphabetical handle.

## 🗺️ Placement & UI Hints

* Higher score → closer to center of Radar and/or stronger pulse.
* Accessible list view sorts descending by score with subtle labels (e.g., “good fit”).
* No badges that imply status or popularity.

---

## 🔧 Tuning & Controls

* Expose weights in a config file the team can A/B quietly.
* Add a user toggle: **Show only vibe matches** (optional, defaults off).
* Soft caps: never let any single factor dominate beyond set limits (e.g., tag cap at 3).

---

## 🧪 Data & Privacy

* Only keep **aggregate metrics**: how often chats start after a top‑3 suggestion; average chat duration bucket; panic rate by vibe.
* **Never store** message content or precise coordinates.
* Session IDs auto‑expire; scores are recomputed live.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Abuse Handling

* Automatic exclusion on recent panic.
* Optional shadow‑cooldown if a user is rapidly declined by many (post‑MVP; design carefully to avoid bias).
* Clear microcopy: the system is about **compatibility now**, not ranking people.

---

## 🔭 Post‑MVP Roadmap (Flags)

* **Passive feedback**: lightweight signals like accept/decline taps, chat dwell time bucket (short/medium/long) → small future weight.
* **Personality archetypes**: opt‑in Myers‑Briggs‑lite archetype adds another small, explainable factor.
* **Social enrichment**: if user connects Spotify/Reddit/X, map top themes to tags; strictly opt‑in.
* **Context modes**: event/venue themes temporarily bias scores (e.g., “Hackathon: builders up‑weighted”).

---

## 🧭 Fairness & Guardrails

* Cap any factor’s contribution; prefer multiple small signals to a single strong one.
* Audit weights when moving between contexts (campus vs. conference).
* Provide a simple in‑app explanation: *“People you see first share your vibe, tags, and are nearby.”*

---

## ✅ Acceptance (MVP)

* Radar sort order reflects vibe/tag/visibility/distance as defined.
* Safety exclusions work deterministically.
* Config weights exist and can be changed without code rewrites.
* No user is fully hidden by score alone (only by safety rules).
* A11y list view presents the same order as the visual radar.
