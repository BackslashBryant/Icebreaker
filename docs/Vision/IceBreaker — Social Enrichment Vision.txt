# IceBreaker — Social Enrichment Vision

> Post‑MVP, optional. Purpose: let users **auto‑suggest vibes/tags** from the public signals they already have on other platforms — without compromising IceBreaker’s privacy ethos or creating identity theater.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Make setup **faster and more authentic** for willing users.
* Keep it **clearly opt‑in**, revocable, and transparent.
* Map external signals to **present‑tense vibes/tags**, not permanent labels.

---

## 🧭 Principles

1. **User first**: nothing pulls without explicit consent and a clear preview.
2. **Minimal scopes**: request only what’s needed for suggestions; read‑only.
3. **Local mapping**: transform data into IceBreaker tags/vibes; discard raw data.
4. **Ephemeral**: suggestions refresh occasionally; no long‑term profiling.
5. **Explainable**: user can see why a suggestion appeared and remove it.

## 🔌 Target Integrations (phased)

* **Spotify**: top artists/genres → “Creative Energy”, “Lo‑fi head”, etc.
* **Reddit**: top sub interests → “Builder brain”, “Tech curious”, etc.
* **Twitter/X** (if feasible): liked/followed themes → “Web tinkerer”, “News‑savvy”.

> Start with one provider (Spotify or Reddit) to validate UX and trust.

## 🧩 UX Flow (Profile → Connect)

1. **Prompt**: “Want quicker setup? Connect a service to auto‑suggest tags.”
2. **Consent screen**: shows provider, scopes (read‑only), and examples of what we’ll infer.
3. **OAuth**: standard provider login.
4. **Preview**: show suggested tags with dismiss toggles; user selects what to keep.
5. **Done**: saved tags appear like any other; user can disconnect anytime.

**Microcopy anchors**

* Button: *“Connect to get suggestions”*
* Scope note: *“Read‑only. Used to suggest tags. You choose what sticks.”*
* Disconnect: *“Stop using suggestions and remove imported tags.”*

## 🗺️ Mapping Model (explainable)

* Provider themes → **candidate tags** with confidence buckets (high/med/low).
* Cap suggestions (e.g., max 5) to avoid noise.
* Never auto‑apply: **user confirms** each tag.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Handling

* Store only **selected tags**; discard raw provider data after mapping.
* No storing of track lists, follows, or histories.
* Re‑pull only on explicit refresh.
* Clear “Why this tag?” info (e.g., “From your top genres last month”).

---

## ⚙️ Product Implications

* **Signal Engine**: enriched tags behave exactly like manual tags; no extra weight beyond caps.
* **Onboarding**: keep **Vibe required**; enrichment is **optional** and shown in Profile or post‑onboarding nudge.
* **Safety**: no public badges for connected accounts; no links out by default.

---

## 🧪 Rollout Plan

* Phase 1: Single provider beta (Spotify or Reddit) with feature flag.
* Phase 2: Add second provider; measure trust/usage.
* Phase 3: Contextual suggestions (e.g., event themes) without OAuth.

**KPIs**

* Opt‑in rate, tag acceptance rate per provider.
* Time to first chat vs. non‑connected users.
* Report/Panic rates (should not increase).

---

## 🧭 Guardrails & Risks

* **Scope creep**: keep scopes minimal and visible.
* **Misclassification**: user review required; easy removal.
* **API volatility**: design with provider abstraction; graceful fallback.
* **Perceived status**: never boost visibility just for connecting; value is authenticity, not clout.

---

## ✅ Acceptance (post‑MVP)

* Users can connect a provider, preview suggestions, select/dismiss, and disconnect.
* Only selected tags persist; raw data is discarded after mapping.
* No special ranking boost for enriched tags beyond existing caps.
* UX copy and consent screens make purpose and privacy clear.
* Feature can be toggled off globally without breaking Profile.

> Keep this a convenience, not a requirement. It should feel like a shortcut to a more *true‑to‑you now* signal — never a new profile to maintain.
