# IceBreaker — Developer Vision Brief

> Team — this is the **North Star**. No stacks. No tickets. Just why we exist, what this should *feel* like, and how we make decisions when the details get messy. Build for real humans meeting in real places, briefly and safely.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

IceBreaker helps nearby adults connect for a short, safe conversation and then move on. Not a feed. Not forever. **A moment.**

**If other apps are loud nightclubs, IceBreaker is the quiet nod across the room.**

---

## 🧭 What We Are / What We’re Not

**We are:**

* A proximity window into the present moment
* Ephemeral conversation, by design
* Calm, privacy‑first, opt‑in

**We’re not:**

* A dating app, social graph, or profile showcase
* A place for scrolling, clout, or permanence
* A data collection project

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who This Is For

Adults (18+) in shared spaces — campuses, events, coworking spots, dense neighborhoods — who want **lightweight, authentic contact** without committing to an identity performance.

They value: control, subtlety, safety, and a vibe that doesn’t try too hard.

---

## 🌀 Core Experience (end‑to‑end)

1. **Welcome** → "Real world. Real time. Real connections." Clear choice to continue or bounce.
2. **Consent & Clarity** → 18+ confirm; plain‑language location explainer.
3. **Vibe & Optional Tags** → *Required current mood; optional identity hints.* Skipping tags is allowed but lowers discoverability.
4. **Radar** → Ambient presence; see who’s open nearby.
5. **Chat** → One‑tap, terminal‑style, ephemeral. Ends when the moment ends.
6. **Panic** → Always there. One tap to exit and alert contacts. Calm, not dramatic.

## 🎨 Brand & UI Ethos (must follow)

**Theme:** Retro‑handheld charm + modern minimalism ("terminal meets Game Boy").

* **Base:** deep navy / charcoal
* **Accent:** neon teal
* **Secondary:** warm gray
* **Type:** IBM Plex Mono / Space Mono (caps for headers)
* **Buttons:** teal, rounded‑2xl, hover darken, crisp focus rings
* **Icons:** simple, squared, pixel‑friendly
* **Motion:** subtle CRT sweep, blink, and pulse — always respect reduced‑motion
* **A11y:** high‑contrast mode, screen reader labels, keyboard‑first paths

> **Rule:** If a screen breaks the vibe, it breaks the brand. Don’t ship it.

## 🧩 Interest/Vibe Philosophy (authentic, not performative)

* **Required:** a simple **Vibe** (your current energy: Up for banter / Open to intros / Thinking out loud / Killing time / Surprise me).
* **Optional:** a few **Tags** that hint at wavelength (Quietly Curious, Creative Energy, Overthinking Things, Big Sci‑Fi Brain, Here for the humans).
* **Skip tags:** allowed, but **reduced visibility** on Radar (soft penalty).
* **Future‑proofing flags:**

  * Social enrichment via opt‑in OAuth (Spotify/Reddit/X) — **post‑MVP**
  * Personality/archetype mode (Myers‑Briggs‑lite) — **experiment later**

## 🎛️ Sifting the Noise (compatibility without creepiness)

**Lightweight scoring for Radar priority (MVP):**

* 🎯 **Vibe match** (same vibe) — stronger signal
* 🔗 **Shared tags** — incremental boost per match
* 🧍 **Visibility on** — small boost
* 🚫 **No tags** — soft penalty
* 🛟 **Safety signal** (recent panic) — hide

No one is fully hidden (unless safety applies). **Presence ≠ pressure.** The radar simply puts *better fits* closer to the center.

> **Future flag:** A "Signal Engine" may learn from soft feedback (accept/decline, chat duration) — never storing message content and always privacy‑respecting.

## 🔐 Privacy & Safety Posture

* Approximate distance only; no background tracking; no precise location history
* Ephemeral chat; no long‑term transcripts
* Panic is visible, fast, and calm; alerts include time + coarse area only
* Clear, reversible controls for visibility and a11y

---

## 🧠 Decision Rules (use these when you’re unsure)

1. **Privacy > precision**
2. **Simplicity > cleverness**
3. **A11y is the bar** (not a bonus)
4. **Vibe is the product** — if it doesn’t feel like IceBreaker, don’t do it
5. **Choice everywhere** — opt‑in, opt‑out, consequence is soft not punitive

---

## 📏 Success (non‑technical, experience‑level)

* New user understands the premise **within 10 seconds**
* Onboarding to Radar **in under 30 seconds**
* First chat is **one tap** and feels instant
* Ending is **clean and expected** ("Connection lost. Chat deleted.")
* Users feel **safe** because Panic is obvious and respectful
* Accessibility modes are honored across all screens

---

## 🗣️ Metaphors that guide us

* **A walkie‑talkie for nearby humans**
* **A radar ping that finds the right kind of now**
* **A match strike that burns bright and fades**

---

## 🎯 Final word

Build for **brief, real, human** moments. Keep it quiet, clean, and intentional. If a choice risks the vibe, choose the vibe.

*That’s IceBreaker.*
