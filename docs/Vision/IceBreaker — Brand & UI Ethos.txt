# IceBreaker — Brand & UI Ethos

> This is the shared style bible. If a screen breaks the vibe, it breaks the brand. Keep it quiet, clean, and intentional.

## 🧭 North Star

* **We are:** A calm, opt‑in way to meet nearby people in the moment.
* **We’re not:** A dating app, public feed, or profile parade.
* **Feelings to evoke:** Curiosity, safety, ease, a touch of nerdy‑cool.
* **Metaphors:** Walkie‑talkie for nearby humans. Radar ping. Match strike that fades.

## 🎨 Visual System

**Theme:** Retro‑handheld charm + modern minimalism (terminal meets Game Boy).

* **Base:** Deep navy (#0A0F1F) or charcoal (#0D0D0D)
* **Accent:** Neon teal (#00B8D9)
* **Secondary:** Warm gray (#C2C2C2)
* **Typography:** IBM Plex Mono / Space Mono (headers in caps; body in sentence case)
* **Iconography:** Simple line icons with squared/pixel‑friendly corners
* **Buttons:** Rounded‑2xl, solid teal fill, hover darken, crisp focus ring
* **Dividers:** ASCII‑style where fitting

> Use space generously. One strong action per screen.

## ♿ Accessibility

* **Reduced‑motion:** Disable sweeps, blinks, pulses.
* **High‑contrast:** Brighten teal; maintain WCAG text contrast.
* **Keyboard/Screen reader:** Clear focus states; ARIA labels everywhere.
* **Language:** Plain, short sentences. No jargon.

> A11y is the baseline, not a bonus.

## ✍️ Tone & Microcopy

* **Voice:** Confident, succinct, slightly playful; never clingy or hypey.
* **Examples:**

  * Welcome: *"Real world. Real time. Real connections."* + *"No feed. No followers. Just now."*
  * Empty Radar: *“No one here — yet.”*
  * Chat end: *“Connection lost. Chat deleted.”*
  * Panic confirm: *“Everything okay?”*
* **Do:** Offer choices, be kind, be clear.
* **Don’t:** Guilt, nag, or oversell.

## 🧩 Core Components

* **Buttons:** Primary / secondary / icon‑only in teal, rounded‑2xl
* **Inputs:** Monospace fields; blinking cursor on focus
* **Chips:** Chunky pixel‑style for vibes and tags
* **Toasts:** Top‑center, monospace, neutral language
* **FAB (Panic):** Teal outline; always visible on Radar and Chat

## 🗺️ Screens — Feel & Promise

* **Splash / Welcome:** Brand moment. Clear choice to enter or bounce.
* **Onboarding:** Consent, clarity, control. It’s the buy‑in moment.
* **Vibe & Tags:** Present state first (required vibe), identity hints optional.
* **Profile:** Agency over what’s visible; emergency contacts.
* **Radar:** Ambient presence; quiet relevance; no pressure.
* **Chat:** Terminal‑style, quick, meaningful; then it fades.
* **Panic:** Reassuring, immediate, never dramatic.
* **Settings:** “Your space, your rules.”

## ⚙️ Product Principles (UI implications)

1. **Presence over profile** → No avatars or follower cues on Radar.
2. **Ephemeral by default** → Visuals should imply impermanence (e.g., gentle sweep).
3. **Privacy first** → Approximate distance only; clear visibility toggles.
4. **Simplicity wins** → Fewer controls, fewer states, one intent per screen.
5. **Safety visible** → Panic is obvious and reachable with keyboard.

## ✅ Acceptance (Brand/UI)

* Palette, type, icons, and components match this doc.
* Copy follows tone; examples are the benchmark.
* Reduced‑motion and high‑contrast modes function and persist.
* Interactions feel calm, intentional, and consistent across screens.

> If in doubt, remove noise. Let the moment breathe.
