# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code with clear naming conventions
- Follow established patterns and architectural principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Maintain high test coverage with meaningful tests

### Testing Standards
- Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Ensure all critical paths are covered
- Maintain test documentation and examples

### User Experience Consistency
- Follow established design patterns and UI/UX guidelines
- Ensure accessibility standards are met
- Maintain consistent behavior across all features
- Provide clear feedback and error messages

### Performance Requirements
- Optimize for performance from the start
- Monitor and measure performance metrics
- Implement efficient algorithms and data structures
- Consider scalability and resource usage

## Development Guidelines

### Technical Decisions
- All technical decisions must align with these principles
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Consider long-term maintainability over short-term convenience
- Prioritize security and data protection

### Implementation Choices
- Choose technologies that support our principles
- Favor proven, well-documented solutions
- Consider team expertise and learning curve
- Plan for future evolution and updates

### Quality Assurance
- All code must pass automated quality checks
- Manual review required for critical changes
- Performance testing for performance-critical features
- Security review for security-sensitive components

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundation for all development decisions. When conflicts arise between different principles, the team should discuss and document the resolution, updating this constitution if necessary.

All team members are responsible for upholding these principles and should feel empowered to raise concerns when they see violations.
