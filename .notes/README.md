# Session Notes

Use this directory to keep lightweight, per-session context that helps the next human or agent pick up where you left off.

## How to log a session
- Copy `session-template.md` and rename it with the date or ticket (e.g. `2025-10-30-issue-1234.md`).
- Summarize intent, in-flight tasks, verification status, and blockers.
- Link to related issues/PRs and note any MCP outages or fallbacks.

## Retention
- Keep only current or recent sessions in this folder; archive long-term lessons into `/docs/process-improvement.mdc`.
- Never store secrets or production data here.
