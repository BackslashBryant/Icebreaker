## Why
Validate real interaction dynamics (visibility, compatibility, single chat rule).

## Scope
- For each persona group, add at least one test spawning two contexts (e.g., Maya+Zoe, Marcus+Ethan).
- Assert mutual visibility, signal score deltas, visibility toggle behavior, and chat gating.
- Leverage WS mock + fixtures for deterministic results.

## Acceptance
- Tests fail if personas don't see each other or chat rules misbehave
