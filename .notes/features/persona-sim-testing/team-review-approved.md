All agents have reviewed the plan and provided approval:

- ✅ **@Forge 🔗**: Approved - WebSocket mock approach is sound, non-invasive, handles all message types
- ✅ **@Link 🌐**: Approved - data-testid strategy is best practice, won't interfere with accessibility

- ✅ **@Scout 🔎**: Approved - Plan aligns perfectly with research findings, no gaps identified
- ✅ **@Vector 🎯**: Approved - Plan structure is complete with clear checkpoints

## Concerns Addressed

1. **@Link**: Will ensure all critical interactive elements get data-testid attributes
2. **@Pixel**: Will mask dynamic content in visual regression tests, handle empty telemetry directories
3. **@Nexus**: Will ensure smoke test config doesn't duplicate too much, consider artifact storage limits

## Implementation Approval
