# Features Workspace

Generated specs, plans, and progress logs live here.

- `spec.md` files are generated by `npm run feature:new`.
- `progress.md` tracks stages: Spec -> Plan -> Build -> Ship.
- `archive/` (auto-created) stores completed features.

Do not edit files in this folder manually unless you are cleaning up.
Use the CLI commands instead.
