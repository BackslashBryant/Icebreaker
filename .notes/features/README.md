# Features Workspace

Generated specs and plan-status files live here.

- `spec.md` files are generated by `npm run feature:new`.
- Plan-status files are created at `Docs/plans/Issue-<#>-plan-status.md` (one living document per issue).
- `archive/` (auto-created) stores completed features and archived step files.

**Important**: Each issue should have ONE plan-status file. Do not create separate step files (step1-*.md, step2-*.md, etc.) or progress.md files. All progress tracking happens in the plan-status file.

Do not edit files in this folder manually unless you are cleaning up.
Use the CLI commands instead.
