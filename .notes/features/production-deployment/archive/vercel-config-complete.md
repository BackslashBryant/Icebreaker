## Security Note

**Project Privacy vs Deployment Access**:
- ✅ **Project Private**: Code/repo access remains private (correct security practice)
- ✅ **Deployments Public**: Deployment URLs are accessible (required for app to work)
- ✅ **No Security Issue**: This is the standard setup - private projects can have public deployments
- ✅ **Main Alias 401**: May be expected behavior for private projects - deployment URLs work fine
