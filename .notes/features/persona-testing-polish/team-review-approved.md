**Issue**: #10  
**Plan Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Review Date**: 2025-01-27

## Review Summary

Plan reviewed and approved for implementation. All 7 checkpoints are clear, actionable, and aligned with research findings. Persona-based testing approach is well-structured and comprehensive.

## Team Approval

- ✅ **Scout 🔎**: Research complete (`docs/research/Issue-10-research.md`), plan aligns with findings
- ✅ **Vector 🎯**: Plan created with 7 checkpoints covering journey mapping → testing → polish → documentation
- ✅ **Pixel 🖥️**: Steps 1-4 approved (journey mapping, persona testing). Test structure is clear and feasible
- ✅ **Link 🌐**: Step 5 approved (UX refinement). Brand consistency and accessibility requirements clear
- ✅ **Forge 🔗**: Step 6 approved (edge case resolution). Backend fix scope is appropriate
- ✅ **Muse 🎨**: Step 7 approved (documentation). Documentation structure is comprehensive

## Plan Highlights

- **7 Steps**: Journey mapping → Core testing → Professional testing → Market research testing → UX polish → Edge cases → Documentation
- **Research Complete**: Comprehensive methodology documented
- **Persona Coverage**: All 10 personas covered (5 core + 5 market research)
- **Out of Scope**: Appropriately scoped (polish only, no new features)
- **Rollback Plans**: Defined for each step

## Key Decisions

1. **Journey Mapping**: Comprehensive approach covering all touchpoints (onboarding → vibe/tags → radar → chat → exit)
2. **Test Structure**: Persona-specific test files grouped by persona type (college students, professionals, market research)
3. **Multi-Persona Testing**: Start with automated tests, fallback to manual if needed
4. **UX Feedback**: Collect during testing, prioritize based on persona impact
5. **Edge Cases**: Fix critical issues, document non-critical for future

## Next Steps

Proceed with Step 1: Persona Journey Mapping (@Vector + @Pixel)
