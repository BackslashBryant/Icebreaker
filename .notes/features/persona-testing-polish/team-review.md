# Team Review - Issue #10: Persona-Based Testing & Polish

**Feature**: Persona-Based Testing & Polish  
**Issue**: #10  
**Plan Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Review Date**: 2025-01-27

## Plan Summary

**7 Steps**:
1. Persona Journey Mapping (@Vector + @Pixel)
2. Core Persona Testing - College Students (@Pixel)
3. Professional Persona Testing (@Pixel)
4. Market Research Persona Testing (@Pixel)
5. UX Refinement & Polish (@Link + @Pixel)
6. Edge Case Resolution (@Forge + @Link)
7. Persona Testing Documentation (@Muse)

**Research Status**: ✅ Complete (`docs/research/Issue-10-research.md`)

**Goals**:
- All 10 personas tested through complete user journeys
- UX refinements identified and prioritized
- Edge cases discovered and fixed
- User flow optimizations implemented
- App polished to match persona expectations

**Out of Scope**:
- New feature development (focus on polish only)
- Performance optimization (separate issue)
- Security audit (covered in Issue #6)
- Cross-browser testing (covered in Issue #6)

## Team Review

### @Scout 🔎 - Research Review
**Status**: ✅ Research complete
**Notes**: Research file created with comprehensive methodology. Plan aligns with research findings. Personas well-defined, test infrastructure exists.

### @Vector 🎯 - Plan Review
**Status**: ✅ Plan created
**Notes**: 7-step plan covers journey mapping → testing → polish → documentation. Clear acceptance tests and rollback plans defined.

### @Pixel 🖥️ - Testing Review
**Status**: ⏸️ Pending review
**Notes**: Steps 1-4 involve testing work. Need to review:
- Journey mapping approach
- Persona test structure
- Multi-persona simulation feasibility
- Edge case discovery process

### @Link 🌐 - Frontend Review
**Status**: ⏸️ Pending review
**Notes**: Step 5 involves UX refinement. Need to review:
- UX feedback collection process
- Brand consistency requirements
- Accessibility preservation

### @Forge 🔗 - Backend Review
**Status**: ⏸️ Pending review
**Notes**: Step 6 involves edge case fixes. Need to review:
- Edge case prioritization
- Backend fix scope
- Rollback procedures

### @Muse 🎨 - Documentation Review
**Status**: ⏸️ Pending review
**Notes**: Step 7 involves documentation. Need to review:
- Documentation structure
- Results format
- Insights capture approach

## Review Questions

1. **Journey Mapping**: Is the journey mapping approach comprehensive enough? Should we include more touchpoints?
2. **Test Structure**: Are persona-specific test files the right approach? Should we group differently?
3. **Multi-Persona Testing**: Is automated multi-persona simulation feasible, or should we use manual testing?
4. **UX Feedback**: How should we prioritize UX improvements discovered during testing?
5. **Edge Cases**: What's the threshold for fixing vs. documenting edge cases?

## Next Steps

After team review approval:
1. Create feature branch: `agent/vector/10-persona-testing-polish`
2. Begin Step 1: Persona Journey Mapping
3. Proceed through steps sequentially
