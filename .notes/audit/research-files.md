## Missing Research Files

No research files found for:
- Issue #1 (Onboarding - CLOSED)
- Issue #2 (Radar View - OPEN)
- Issue #3 (Chat - no GitHub issue)
- Issue #4 (Chat - OPEN)
- Issue #5 (Panic Button - CLOSED)
- Issue #9 (Persona Fixtures - OPEN)
- Issue #11-23 (All OPEN issues)

## Inconsistencies

1. **Issue #10 Duplicates**: Two research files reference Issue #10:
   - `Issue-10-research.md`
   - `Issue-10-backend-server-startup.md`

2. **Issue #7**: Research file exists but no GitHub issue

3. **Missing Research**: Most open issues don't have research files

4. **Naming Inconsistency**: One file uses `Issue-10-backend-server-startup.md` format instead of standard `Issue-<#>-research.md`

## Research File Naming Pattern

**Standard Pattern**: `Issue-<number>-research.md`
**Exception**: `Issue-10-backend-server-startup.md` (includes feature name)
