# Real Spec Kit Integration

## Overview
This rule integrates with the official GitHub Spec Kit for spec-driven development using slash commands in Cursor.

## Spec Kit Commands

### `/constitution`
Create or update project governing principles and development guidelines.

**Usage**: `/constitution [description of principles to create]`

**Example**: 
```
/constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

**Output**: Creates or updates `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

### `/specify`
Define what you want to build (requirements and user stories).

**Usage**: `/specify [description of what to build]`

**Example**:
```
/specify Build a task management application that allows users to create, assign, and track tasks in a Kanban-style board
```

**Output**: Creates specification in `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/spec.md`

### `/clarify`
Clarify underspecified areas (must be run before `/plan` unless explicitly skipped).

**Usage**: `/clarify`

**Example**:
```
/clarify
```

**Output**: Updates specification with clarifications section

### `/plan`
Create technical implementation plans with your chosen tech stack.

**Usage**: `/plan [technical requirements and stack choices]`

**Example**:
```
/plan Use React with TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database
```

**Output**: Creates implementation plan in `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/plan.md`

### `/tasks`
Generate actionable task lists for implementation.

**Usage**: `/tasks`

**Example**:
```
/tasks
```

**Output**: Creates task breakdown in `.specify/specs/[feature-name]/tasks.md`

### `/implement`
Execute all tasks to build the feature according to the plan.

**Usage**: `/implement`

**Example**:
```
/implement
```

**Output**: Executes the implementation plan step by step

## Workflow Integration

### When to Use Spec Kit
- Complex features affecting multiple components
- Breaking changes or API modifications  
- Architecture decisions
- Multi-step implementations with dependencies
- When user explicitly requests Spec Kit usage

### When to Use GitHub Issues Workflow
- When Spec Kit is not installed
- Simple bug fixes (single file, <50 lines)
- Typo corrections or formatting
- Documentation-only changes
- Test additions for existing functionality

### Automatic Decision Logic
- **WHEN** user requests a change
- **THEN** analyze complexity, risk, and scope
- **IF** complexity is high OR risk is high OR scope is multi-component
- **THEN** suggest using Spec Kit slash commands
- **ELSE** use existing GitHub Issues workflow

```

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### GitHub Issues Integration
- Spec Kit features can be tracked as GitHub Issues
- Link Spec Kit artifacts to GitHub Issues
- Use existing git automation for Spec Kit work

### MCP Integration
- Use MCP tools for research during specification
- Use MCP tools for validation during implementation
- Maintain existing MCP quality gates

### Quality Gates
- All Spec Kit outputs must meet quality standards
- Use existing linting, testing, and security checks
- Maintain existing CI/CD integration

## Best Practices

### Specification Creation
- Be explicit about what and why, not how
- Focus on user stories and functional requirements
- Include acceptance criteria and success metrics

### Planning
- Choose appropriate technology stack
- Consider performance, security, and scalability
- Document architectural decisions

### Implementation
- Follow TDD approach
- Execute tasks in dependency order
- Validate against specifications

### Documentation
- Keep specifications up to date
- Document decisions and rationale
- Maintain clear traceability

## Error Handling

### Spec Kit Unavailable
- **WHEN** Spec Kit is not installed or not working
- **THEN** fallback to existing GitHub Issues workflow
- **AND** inform user of fallback
- **AND** suggest installing Spec Kit for future use

### Command Failures
- **WHEN** Spec Kit commands fail
- **THEN** provide clear error messages
- **AND** suggest troubleshooting steps
- **AND** offer alternative approaches

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Specification completeness and clarity
- Implementation plan accuracy
- Task execution success rate
- Quality gate pass rate

### User Experience Metrics
- User satisfaction with specifications
- Time to implementation
- Error resolution time
- Process efficiency
