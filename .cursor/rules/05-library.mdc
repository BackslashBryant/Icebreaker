# Library Reference Pointer

The full collection of conventions and reusable snippets now lives outside the
default ruleset so Cursor only loads it when a session truly needs the extra
weight.

- Source document: `docs/library/library-reference.md`
- Usage: mention `@docs/library/library-reference.md` or quote the relevant
  sections when you want the agent anchored to the handbook.
- Why manual: Cursor docs and community guidance recommend focused rules (<500
  lines) and manual opt-in for encyclopedic material so the model keeps context
  budget for creative flow.

## When to pull the library in

- You are touching legacy or compliance-heavy surfaces where established
  patterns matter.
- Code review or onboarding requires precise references to naming, structure, or
  workflow conventions.
- You are switching from vibe mode into structured delivery and need exact
  playbooks.

If you are just riffing in vibe mode, rely on `AGENTS.md` and the core rules to
set the tone. Keep the heavy library manual so improvisation stays quick.***
