# Lessons Learned

Use `scripts/lessons-log` to append new entries here. Keep them concise, describe the trigger, the lesson, and the rule/update that resulted.

## 2024-12-19: MCP-First Git Operations

**Trigger**: User requested git push, agent used terminal commands instead of GitHub MCP
**Lesson**: The rules clearly state that git operations should use GitHub MCP first (line 36 in 04-integrations.mdc: "git", "commit", "push", "branch", "pr", "pull request" → GitHub MCP)
**Root Cause**: Agent didn't check MCP triggers before falling back to terminal commands
**Rule Update**: Add explicit MCP-first check in workflow rules

**Action Required**: 
- Update workflow rules to include MCP trigger check as mandatory first step
- Add explicit "MCP-first" decision tree in git operations
- Ensure agent checks MCP availability before terminal fallback
