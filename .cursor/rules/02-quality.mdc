# Verification & Quality Gates

## Automated Checks
- Prefer scripted checks whenever possible; expose them via the repository's package runner (npm/pnpm/yarn/uv/etc.) so `scripts/verify-all` can discover and execute them.
- Keep validations fast and deterministic so they can run locally and in CI.
- When adding a new stack, update `scripts/verify-all` or your package scripts to include lint, test, build, type, and audit steps appropriate to that stack.
- Run the smallest useful test suite immediately after every code change. Post the command and result in chat so reviewers can trace regressions to a single edit.

## Manual Validation
- Document any manual verification performed (UI walkthroughs, API calls, accessibility checks).
- Capture screenshots, console output, or logs; attach them to the ticket/PR.
- Note residual risk or missing coverage so it can be automated later.
- When a loop occurs (same fix attempted twice without progress), stop, document it in `.notes/features/<slug>/progress.md` under **Current Issues**, and reset the chat before trying again.

## CI Expectations
- `Template CI` currently runs the preflight check and best-effort verification helper.
- Extend the workflow once your stack is generated (e.g., add matrix jobs for frontend/backend services) and hook in any new verification commands you introduced.

# Security & Dependencies

## Safe Defaults
- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or personal data.
- Store configuration in environment variables or secret managers; document required keys in project docs.
- Review new dependencies for maintenance state, licensing, and support plans.

## Automation Aids
- Example security tooling lives in `examples/automation/`; copy only what your project needs.
- If you adopt a dependency audit or custom security script, wire it into your verify step and CI.

# Git Hygiene

- **BEFORE starting work**: Create branch with format `agent/<agent>/<issue>-<slug>` (e.g., `agent/vector/1-onboarding-flow`) per `.cursor/rules/01-workflow.mdc`. Never work on existing branches unless they match the issue.
- One issue/task per branch; name it `agent/<agent>/<issue>-<slug>` (preferred) or `feat/<issue>-<slug>` (fallback).
- Keep commits scoped and reference the issue ID in the message: `feat: Complete Issue #X - [description]`.
- **When completing a feature**: Update GitHub issue with completion comment, commit changes, then ask before pushing.
- Use GitHub MCP (or `gh`) for branch pushes, PR updates, and reviews. Terminal git is a fallback for commits.
- Ask before committing or pushing; surface the staged diff and test results for approval.
- Merge cleanly (squash/rebase) after quality gates are green and the ticket is updated.
- Install the provided git hook (`scripts/git-hooks/install`) so `.cursor/` changes never leave your machine unless you intentionally set `ALLOW_CURSOR_PUSH=1`.

# MCP Quality Checkpoints

- **UI / Accessibility**: Playwright MCP for screenshots, axe/Lighthouse when UI changes.
- **Data / Storage**: Supabase MCP for schema diffs, advisor checks, and logs.
- **Research**: DocFork MCP or Context7 for official references; summarize findings in the ticket.
- **System Ops**: Desktop Commander MCP for local shell automation when allowed.
- Always log citations in `/docs/research.md` when Docfork, Scout, or Vector pulls references.

Document the MCP run outputs or link to transcripts so reviewers can see what was validated.

# Agent Review & Diffs

- Run Cursor's **Agent Review** on every PR before handing it to humans; let it scan the diff for regressions, insecure code, or missing tests.
- Use @symbols (`@file-tree`, `@Cursor Rules`, specific filenames) to keep the agent's context precise and under token limits.
- For large/legacy codebases, break work into phases (structure/test scaffolds first, logic second) so Agent Review focuses on manageable diffs.
- Prefer using the Agent CLI/headless agents for long-running refactors or CI hooks; log their output in the issue.

---

# Lessons Learned & Rule Updates
- Treat every bug, regression, or avoided incident as an opportunity to harden the rules.
- Append actionable notes to `.cursor/rules/07-process-improvement.mdc`; when a theme recurs, evolve or add a rule file so the fix becomes default behavior.
- Reference evidence (logs, PRs, incidents) when writing lessons so future agents understand the context.

# Quality Checklist

- [ ] Preflight succeeded (run `tools/preflight.mjs` via your runtime of choice).
- [ ] Plan/tasks executed (Spec Kit or manual plan).
- [ ] Automated checks run (`scripts/verify-all` or stack-specific equivalents).
- [ ] Manual checks (if any) recorded with evidence.
- [ ] Issue/Spec updated with outcome, risk, follow-ups, and MCP recommendations.
- [ ] Git branch merged and cleaned up.
- [ ] Lessons learned documented and, if necessary, rules updated to prevent recurrence.

Anything left unchecked should be captured as follow-up work.
