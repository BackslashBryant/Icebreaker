# GitHub-Centric Workflow

This repo assumes GitHub hosts the project, issues drive the work, and Cursor Agents execute sequentially. Every contribution should leave an auditable trail in GitHub (issues, branches, PRs, checks) and must respect the Plan Mode → Act Mode checkpoints defined in `docs/Plan.md`.

## 0. Start From a GitHub Issue
- Before anything else, confirm `docs/vision.md` and `docs/ConnectionGuide.md` are current.
- Every feature, bug, or spike starts as an Issue.
- If none exists, open one with the appropriate template (`/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).
- Reference the issue URL in `/docs/Plan.md`, commits, and PR description.

## 0.5. Research (Scout) - MANDATORY FIRST STEP
- **MANDATORY**: Scout must research the feature/issue BEFORE planning begins.
- Create issue-specific research file: `docs/research/Issue-<#>-research.md`
- Research question, sources, findings, recommendations, rollback options
- **PAUSE**: Research must be complete and documented before Vector creates plan.
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Do not proceed to planning without completed research.

## 1. Plan (Vector) - MANDATORY AFTER RESEARCH
- **MANDATORY**: Vector must wait for Scout's research to be complete.
- Reference Scout's research file: `docs/research/Issue-<#>-research.md`
- Use Cursor Plan Mode with the issue context plus `docs/vision.md` and research findings.
- Save the plan to `/docs/Plan.md` (3-7 numbered checkpoints, acceptance tests, owners). Include "Do not continue past step _n_ without approval."
- Add labels: `agent:vector`, relevant implementer labels, and `status:plan`.
- **PAUSE**: Plan must be reviewed by team before implementation begins.
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Do not proceed to implementation without team review of plan.

## 1.5. Team Review - MANDATORY BEFORE EXECUTION
- **MANDATORY**: All agents review the plan and provide notes/feedback.
- Vector coordinates team review session.
- Address any concerns or gaps before proceeding.
- **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT**: Create `.notes/features/<slug>/team-review-approved.md` file ONLY after all agents have reviewed and approved the plan.
- **PAUSE**: Implementation cannot begin until plan is approved by team AND approval file exists.
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Do not proceed to implementation without team approval AND approval file.
- **VERIFICATION**: Before starting any implementation work, check that `.notes/features/<slug>/team-review-approved.md` exists. If missing, STOP and coordinate team review.

## 2. Branching & MCP Setup
- **MANDATORY**: Create branch with format `agent/<agent>/<issue>-<slug>` (e.g. `agent/link/1234-header`) **BEFORE starting any work**. Check current branch matches the issue being worked on. If on wrong branch, create correct branch and move commits.
- **CRITICAL**: Before ANY git operation (add, commit, push), verify:
  1. Current directory is the project root (contains `.git` folder)
  2. Current branch matches the issue being worked on (check with `git branch --show-current`)
  3. If directory is wrong, navigate to project root: `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`
  4. If branch is wrong, create correct branch or switch: `git checkout -b agent/<agent>/<issue>-<slug>`
- **NEVER** run git commands from parent directories or outside the repository
- Branch name format: `agent/<agent>/<issue>-<slug>` (e.g. `agent/link/1234-header`).
- Install/refresh GitHub MCP in Cursor; authenticate using a PAT with `repo`, `workflow`, `issues`.
- Nexus or the acting human runs `npm run agents:install-hook` to copy the path-scope pre-commit hook locally.
- Run `npm run preflight` before pushing to ensure scaffolding is intact (includes branch name validation).
- Execute `npm run mcp:suggest` after dependency or config changes and note the recommendations in `.notes/` or the active plan; run `npm run mcp:suggest -- --install <id>` to append required servers to `.cursor/mcp.json`.
- Record any new ports, endpoints, or services in `docs/ConnectionGuide.md` immediately.

## 2. Implement (Forge/Link/Glide/Apex/Cider) - MANDATORY AFTER PLAN APPROVAL
- **MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS** (must pass ALL before starting):
  1. Research file exists: `docs/research/Issue-<#>-research.md`
  2. Plan file exists: `docs/Plan.md` with checkpoints
  3. **Team review approval file exists**: `.notes/features/<slug>/team-review-approved.md`
  4. Plan explicitly states "Team review complete - approved for implementation"
- **IF ANY CHECK FAILS**: STOP immediately. Do not create, modify, or commit any implementation files. Report which check failed and coordinate with Vector.
- Stay in Plan Mode until the caller says "Proceed." Once approved, execute one checkpoint at a time.
- Work within your agent branch and path scope.
- Commit early/often; reference the issue (`#1234`) in commit messages.
- Run targeted tests right after each change; paste the command/output in chat.
- Update `.notes/features/<slug>/progress.md` with **Current Issues** if something fails or loops.
- Push directly to GitHub branch (no PR needed). Commit and push when ready.
- Use GitHub MCP (or `gh`) for branch creation. Terminal git is used for commits and pushes.

## 4. Verify (Pixel, Muse, Nexus, Sentinel)
- Pixel runs `npm run verify` (or agreed scripts) after every checkpoint; report GREEN/RED with file:line references and repro commands. If red, halt and assign back.
- `npm run verify` surfaces the MCP suggestion summary; log any add/remove actions before marking verification complete.
- Muse updates README/CHANGELOG/docs, cites tests, references `docs/vision.md`, and keeps `docs/ConnectionGuide.md` consistent.
- Nexus confirms GitHub Actions succeeded, configures environment variables/Secrets, and keeps status checks enforced. Record every change in the Connection Guide.
- Sentinel jumps in for auth/secret/PII-sensitive work, leaving notes under `/docs/security/`.

## 5. Direct Commits (No PRs)
- Direct commits to feature branches. No PRs needed.
- Commit messages should reference the issue: `feat: Complete Issue #X - [description]`
- **MANDATORY PRE-COMMIT CHECKS** (must pass ALL before committing):
  1. Verify current directory is project root: Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and ensure you're in that directory
  2. Verify current branch matches issue: Run `git branch --show-current` and confirm branch name contains issue number
  3. Verify no parent directory scanning: `git status` should NOT show files outside the repository
  4. If ANY check fails: Navigate to project root with `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` and re-verify
- Always ask before pushing (per agent rules).

## 6. Close the Loop
- **Issue completion checklist** (must complete all - NO EXCEPTIONS):
  1. Commit all changes with message referencing issue: `feat: Complete Issue #X - [description]`
  2. **MANDATORY**: Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin agent/<agent>/<issue>-<slug>` 
     - If authentication fails, configure credential helper: `git config --global credential.helper manager-core`
     - If push still fails, check `Docs/troubleshooting/git-push-hotwash.md` for solutions
     - **DO NOT** ask user for permission - this is a mandatory completion step
  3. **MANDATORY**: Update GitHub issue with completion comment using `gh issue comment <issue#> --body "..."`:
     - Include: Status summary, branch name, commit hash, test results, files created/modified, next steps
     - **DO NOT** ask user for permission - this is a mandatory completion step
  4. **MANDATORY**: Update GitHub issue labels: `gh issue edit <issue#> --add-label "status:done" --remove-label "status:in-progress"`
     - **DO NOT** ask user for permission - this is a mandatory completion step
  5. Close the Issue with a recap noting direct commits (optional - can leave open for tracking)
- Research file already exists at `docs/research/Issue-<#>-research.md` (created during research phase).
- Archive security notes (if any) in `/docs/security/`.
- Update `/docs/agents/KICKOFF.md` sanity checklist if the flow uncovered gaps.
- **CRITICAL**: Never complete an issue without pushing commits and updating the GitHub issue. This is mandatory, not optional. These steps should happen automatically without user reminders.

## Tooling & Automation
- `npm run agents:prompt -- all` prints prompt bodies for all agents.
- `npm run agents:install-hook` copies the optional path-scope guard into `.git/hooks`.
- `npm run github:labels` (future helper) will seed repo labels defined in `/docs/github/labels.json`.
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`) run preflight + `verify-all`. Extend them as the stack evolves.

## Guardrails
- Never merge directly to `main`. Enforce branch protections: require PR, passing checks, linear history.
- Keep secrets in GitHub Actions secrets or environment variables; never commit `.env` files.
- If MCP access changes (new services, revoked tokens), open an issue for Nexus to update `.cursor/config.json` and automation.
- **Repository Mode**: Template repos track Cursor files (`.cursor/`). App repos block them. The pre-commit hook enforces this separation. See `docs/development/SEPARATION.md` for mode conversion and override procedures.

Follow this loop for every change to keep GitHub the source of truth and Cursor Agents accountable.***
