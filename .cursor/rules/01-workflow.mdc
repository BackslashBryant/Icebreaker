# Complete Development Workflow

## 1) Triage
- Confirm scope, inputs/outputs, constraints, and success criteria.
- List blockers or unknowns explicitly in the ticket.
- **AUTOMATIC**: Analyze request complexity, risk, and scope to determine workflow.
- **AUTOMATIC**: Use Spec Kit workflow if complexity/risk is high, otherwise use GitHub Issues.
- Create GitHub Issue with proper labels and acceptance criteria.

### MCP Checkpoint (mandatory when applicable)
- Research: Built-in web search (current standards), GitHub MCP (patterns), DocFork MCP (official docs).
- Current state (UI/UX tickets): Playwright MCP quick screenshot/accessibility check.

## 2) Plan
- **IF Spec Kit workflow**: Review constitution, clarify requirements, and create implementation plan.
- **IF GitHub Issues workflow**: Draft a mini-plan (3-6 bullets) with risks and selected checks from scripts/verify-all.
- Choose the smallest viable change; avoid architecture shifts unless ticketed.

## 3) Build
- **IF Spec Kit workflow**: Follow Spec Kit implementation plan, validate against requirements.
- **IF GitHub Issues workflow**: Make small, reversible commits and include the ticket ID in messages.
- Modify existing code when possible; keep public APIs stable unless ticketed.

### MCP Checkpoint (while building)
- UI changes: Playwright MCP screenshots and axe checks for impacted screens.
- DB changes: Supabase MCP schema/logs/advisors validation.
- Git operations: GitHub MCP for repository management and operations.

## 4) Verify
- **IF Spec Kit workflow**: Validate against Spec Kit requirements and scenarios.
- **IF GitHub Issues workflow**: Run scripts/verify-all (lint, types, tests, build).
- Capture artifacts such as logs, screenshots, or CLI output.
- When tightening auth or API boundaries, validate both the route and each consuming hook or service and record the check you ran.

### MCP Quality Gates
- UI/Accessibility/Performance scopes: Playwright MCP Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals + axe report required.
- Database scopes: Supabase MCP advisors/logs snapshot required.
- Research scopes: Built-in web search findings summary linked.

## 5) PR
- Use the PR template and request only relevant code owners.
- Link the ticket and include summary, risk note, evidence, and backout plan.

## 6) Ticket Completion (MANDATORY AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW)
**CRITICAL**: All steps must be completed AUTOMATICALLY before marking ticket as done.

### 6.0 Spec Kit Completion (IF Spec Kit workflow)
- **AUTOMATIC**: Validate all requirements and scenarios are met
- **AUTOMATIC**: Update Spec Kit implementation status to completed
- **AUTOMATIC**: Archive Spec Kit implementation
- **AUTOMATIC**: Update specifications if needed

### 6.1 Git Operations (MANDATORY AUTOMATIC - NO EXCEPTIONS)
**AUTOMATIC EXECUTION REQUIRED** - See `.cursor/rules/02-quality.mdc` for complete git workflow details.

**NO USER REMINDERS ALLOWED** - The complete git workflow must execute automatically.

### 6.2 Ticket Management (GitHub Issues-First)
- [ ] Update GitHub Issue status to "COMPLETED"
- [ ] Mark all acceptance criteria as complete in issue
- [ ] Add completion summary as issue comment
- [ ] Close GitHub Issue when work is complete
- [ ] Update `docs/tickets/TICKET_PLAN.md` status (if still using)

### 6.3 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update `docs/PRD.md` Change Log with completion entry
- [ ] Document any new patterns or learnings
- [ ] Update any affected architecture documentation

### 6.4 Quality Gates (NO BYPASSING)
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass (fix underlying issues, don't use --no-verify)
- [ ] All pre-push hooks pass (fix underlying issues, don't use --no-verify)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build successful

### 6.5 Process Improvement
- [ ] Identify any workflow gaps or issues encountered
- [ ] Propose solutions for process improvements
- [ ] Update rules if new patterns discovered

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE ANY STEP = TICKET NOT COMPLETE**

# Intelligent Spec Kit Integration

## Automatic Spec Kit Usage Rules

### When to Automatically Use Spec Kit

**ALWAYS use Spec Kit for:**
- New features affecting multiple components
- Breaking changes or API modifications
- Complex refactoring spanning multiple files
- Security-related changes
- Performance optimizations
- Architecture decisions
- Multi-step implementations with dependencies

**NEVER use Spec Kit for:**
- Simple bug fixes (single file, <50 lines)
- Typo corrections or formatting
- Documentation-only changes
- Test additions for existing functionality
- Dependency updates without behavior changes

### Automatic Decision Logic

#### Complexity Detection
```markdown
IF (estimated_lines > 100 OR files_affected > 3 OR components_affected > 2)
THEN automatically_use_spec_kit_workflow()
```

#### Risk Assessment
```markdown
IF (breaking_change OR security_impact OR performance_impact)
THEN automatically_use_spec_kit_workflow()
```

#### Scope Analysis
```markdown
IF (multi_package OR multi_service OR cross_cutting_concern)
THEN automatically_use_spec_kit_workflow()
```

### Automatic Spec Kit Workflow

#### 1. Context Analysis
- **WHEN** user requests a change
- **THEN** analyze complexity, scope, and risk
- **AND** automatically determine if Spec Kit is needed

#### 2. Automatic Workflow Execution
- **WHEN** Spec Kit is needed
- **THEN** automatically execute: constitution → clarify → plan → implement
- **AND** generate structured requirements and scenarios
- **AND** create implementation tasks

#### 3. Seamless Integration
- **WHEN** using Spec Kit
- **THEN** automatically integrate with existing GitHub Issues
- **AND** maintain ticket synchronization
- **AND** preserve existing workflows

### Implementation Commands

#### Automatic Workflow Execution
```bash
# Cursor automatically runs this when complexity detected
spec-kit clarify --context "user_request" --complexity "high"
spec-kit plan --requirements "clarified_requirements"
spec-kit implement --plan "generated_plan"
```

### Context-Aware Triggers

#### High Complexity Triggers
- Multi-file changes
- New API endpoints
- Database schema changes
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Performance optimizations
- Security implementations

#### Medium Complexity Triggers
- New utility functions
- Component refactoring
- Configuration changes
- Error handling improvements
- Logging enhancements

#### Low Complexity (No Spec Kit)
- Bug fixes
- Typo corrections
- Documentation updates
- Test additions
- Formatting changes

### Automatic Integration Points

#### GitHub Issues Integration
- **WHEN** Spec Kit workflow is used
- **THEN** automatically create corresponding GitHub Issue
- **AND** link Spec Kit implementation to GitHub Issue
- **AND** sync status between systems

#### MCP Integration
- **WHEN** using MCP tools for Spec Kit changes
- **THEN** automatically follow MCP safety policies
- **AND** document MCP usage in implementation
- **AND** track MCP operations in change history

#### CI/CD Integration
- **WHEN** Spec Kit implementation is completed
- **THEN** automatically validate specifications
- **AND** run quality gates
- **AND** update implementation status

### Automatic Implementation Lifecycle

#### 1. Auto-Detection
```markdown
User: "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"
Cursor: [Analyzes complexity] → [Detects high complexity] → [Auto-uses Spec Kit workflow]
```

#### 2. Auto-Clarification
```markdown
Cursor: [Reviews constitution] → [Clarifies requirements] → [Defines scope] → [Validates approach]
```

#### 3. Auto-Planning
```markdown
Cursor: [Creates implementation plan] → [Defines tasks] → [Sets priorities] → [Validates feasibility]
```

#### 4. Auto-Implementation
```markdown
Cursor: [Follows plan] → [Implements features] → [Validates against requirements] → [Updates progress]
```

### Seamless User Experience

#### Transparent Operation
- **WHEN** Spec Kit is used automatically
- **THEN** inform user of Spec Kit usage
- **AND** explain why Spec Kit was chosen
- **AND** show progress and status

#### Fallback to Existing System
- **WHEN** Spec Kit is not needed
- **THEN** use existing GitHub Issues workflow
- **AND** maintain current user experience
- **AND** preserve existing processes

### Automatic Quality Gates

#### Pre-Implementation Validation
- **WHEN** starting Spec Kit implementation
- **THEN** automatically validate requirements
- **AND** check for conflicts with existing specs
- **AND** ensure implementation plan is complete

#### During Implementation Validation
- **WHEN** implementing Spec Kit tasks
- **THEN** automatically validate against requirements
- **AND** check for scope creep
- **AND** ensure quality standards

#### Post-Implementation Validation
- **WHEN** completing Spec Kit implementation
