# Cursor Vibe Operating Agreement

## Flow > Friction
- Start each session by checking intention: prototype, polish, or ship. Narrate it so Agent matches your energy.
- Prefer Plan Mode (Shift+Tab) for anything beyond a single edit. Let Agent draft the plan, tweak it, then build.
- Keep prompts conversational. Voice input, queued messages (Ctrl+Enter), and saved plans are all welcome.

## Safety Rails We Keep Even When Vibing
- Never ship code you have not read; sanity-check diffs and run the quickest meaningful verification.
- Flag real secrets, prod data, or compliance-sensitive areas before asking Agent to touch them.
- Document gotchas in `.notes/` or the active plan so the next session inherits your context.

## Collaboration Rituals
- Reference `AGENTS.md` for tone, preferred stack choices, and review expectations.
- Pin the quick guides under `docs/cursor/` (extensions, symbols, agent tooling) so Cursor stays the SME for new teammates.
- Mention focused rules (e.g. `@rules/testing`) or docs on demand instead of loading the entire library.
- Celebrate experiments: capture wins/misses in `.notes/` (session log) and roll durable lessons into `/docs/process-improvement.mdc` so artifacts capture the session.
- **Cursor vs App Logic Separation**: This repository distinguishes between template mode (Cursor files tracked) and app mode (Cursor files blocked). See `docs/development/SEPARATION.md` for details. In app mode, `.cursor/` modifications are blocked from commits unless `ALLOW_CURSOR_PUSH=1` is set (template updates only). Run `npm run convert:app` when shifting from template to app development.

## Exit Checklist
- Plans or TODOs updated, even if you bail mid-flight.
- Verification helper (`scripts/verify-all` via your preferred runner) invoked and results shared.
- Queue final instructions for Agent if someone is continuing the flow.

## Credibility Over Hype
- Be precise about what succeeded, what failed, and where confidence is low; do not exaggerate accomplishments or gloss over blockers.
- Cite evidence (test output, screenshots, logs) when claiming results.
- When something breaks, document it honestly, propose next steps, and update `.cursor/rules/07-process-improvement.mdc` or other rules so the lesson persists.
- Curate Cursor memories deliberately: propose only reusable insights (architecture, naming), never secrets/PII, and decline noisy suggestions.
