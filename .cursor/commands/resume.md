# Resume Command (continue the plan)

Paste when you want to resume the current feature without hunting context.

```
@Orchestrator Determine the next checkpoint and propose the handoff.

Context:
- Active feature: from .notes/features/current.json
- Plan: docs/Plan.md
- Vision: docs/vision.md

Deliver:
1) Status: current checkpoint + owner
2) Next 3: files to open, tests to run, owner to tag
3) Handoff: ready‑to‑paste message for the owning persona with Plan Mode ask

If the plan/vision is missing or stale, say unknown and list the minimal fixes.
