# Cursor Indexing Exclusions
# This file specifies which files and directories Cursor should exclude from codebase indexing.
# This complements .gitignore but serves a different purpose: optimizing AI indexing performance.
# Files ignored here will not be indexed by Cursor's AI features, improving performance and relevance.
